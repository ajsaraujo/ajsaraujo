## It's a me, Allan 👋

I'm a software developer based in Aracaju, Brazil, where it's hot all year long, the sky is always blue and the beach is just a 15 minutes drive away 🌞🌴🏖️🥥🏃

### About me 
- 💻 I've been working professionally as a software developer since 2020
- 🚀 Lately, I've been working mostly with Angular and Java (Quarkus, Spring), although I also have experience with other tech, such as Node.js and Python. I consider myself a generalist programmer and I'm always open to learn new things
- 🤓 I'm all about building high-quality software and constantly leveling up my skills

### What I'm up to

- 🎓 I'm nearing the end of my graduation, so that's where most of my energy is going. Almost there!
- ⏳ Once that's wrapped up, I hope I'll have more time to work on cool stuff that I can put on GitHub
